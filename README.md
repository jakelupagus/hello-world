# hello-world
first GitHub repository

Hello,

My name is Jake. I work as a software support analyst and software developer for a small company in rural Pennsylvania. I enjoy learning about web development as well as other forms of software development technologies. This will be used sporadically as I attempt new projects while learning different programming languages.
